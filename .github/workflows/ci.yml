# GitHub Actions CI/CD — BTC Prediction Bot
#
# SETUP REQUIRED:
# 1. Go to GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
# 2. Create a new secret named RAILWAY_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL
#    Value: the deploy hook URL from Railway (Project → Settings → Deploy Hooks)
#    Example: https://backboard.railway.app/graphql/internal?...
#
# The deploy job only runs on push to main (not on PRs).
