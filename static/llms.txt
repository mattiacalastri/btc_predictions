## About

BTC Predictor is an open-source autonomous BTC/USD perpetual futures trading system
that combines Claude Sonnet (Anthropic LLM) with XGBoost in a dual-gate prediction
architecture. Every prediction is committed to the Polygon PoS blockchain as an
immutable audit trail before the trade executes on Kraken Futures.

Built by Mattia Calastri, economist (Università di Verona), Verona, Italy.
